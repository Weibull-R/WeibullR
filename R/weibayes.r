# weibayes.r
#
# WeiBayes is a term for a fitting method applicable to data sets with suspensions but very few failures - even one, that
# certainly would defy linear regression methods and present a challenge even for mle fitting.
# Although not a true Bayesian solution the name is given rise due to the input of a "known" (or "prior")
# value for one of the Weibull parameters. Most often, the Beta.
#
# Reliasoft takes issue with the WeiBayes terminology, preferring to reference it as a 1-parameter Weibull method.
# Since one parameter is given as a "known" the resulting fit is a determinant solution. Whereas a true Bayesian solution
# would represent the "prior" as a probability distribution, such that resulting fit must be presented as an uncertainty.
#
# In reality when there is scant failure information uncertainty abounds. Practicioners have confidence using the
# 1-parameter methods, when the character of the item (system, component, or material) in question can be related to previous
# experience. In particular past experience is expectated to relate to the beta parameter.
#
# The first method is very simplistic mathematically, but uncanny in its ability to identify an optimal likelihood.
# This method function is given the simple name weibayes. This method requires a beta value argument.

# The second method uses a true optimization of  the likelihood based on input of either beta or eta.
# This method function is termed weibayes.mle requiring either a beta value or an eta value as input.
#
# Finally a true Bayesian-Weibull will have to express the output as an uncertainty, expected to be similar to confidence bounding.
# A little more research will be made before this implementation is made.
